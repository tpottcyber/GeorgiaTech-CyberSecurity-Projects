### Network Topology

The following machines were identified on the network:

**Name of VM 1 Kali**
- **Operating System**: Linux
- **Purpose**: Used as attacking machine
- **IP Address**:192.168.1.110

**Name of VM 2 Capstone**
- **Operating System**: Linux
- **Purpose**: Used as testing system for alerts
- **IP Address**:192.168.1.105

**Name of VM 2 ELK**
- **Operating System**: Linux
- **Purpose**: Used for gathering information from the victim machine using Metricbeat,
Filebeats, and Packetbeats
- **IP Address**:192.168.1.100

**Name of VM 2 Target 1**
- **Operating System**: Linux
- **Purpose**: The VM with Wordpress as a vulnerable server
- **IP Address**:192.168.1.105

### Description of Targets
The target of this attack was: `Target 1` (192.168.1.110).
Target 1 is an Apache web server and has SSH enabled, so ports 80 and 22 are possible ports
of entry for attackers. As such, the following alerts have been implemented:

### Monitoring the Targets
Traffic to these services should be carefully monitored. To this end, we have implemented the
alerts below:

#### Excessive HTTP Errors
Excessive HTTP Errors is implemented as follows:
- **Metric**: http.response.status_code > 400
- **Threshold**: grouped http response status codes above 400 every 5 minutes
- **Vulnerability Mitigated**: 
1. Utilized intrusion detection/prevention for attacks
2. IPS would block any suspicious IPâ€™s
3. Utilize Account Management to lock or request user accounts to change the passwords every 60 days
4. Filter and disable or close port 22 

- **Reliability**: This alert will not generate an excessive amount of false positives identifying brute force attacks.

#### CPU Usage Monitor
Cpu usage monitor is implemented as follows:
- **Metric**: system.process.cpu.total.pct
- **Threshold**: The maximum cpu total percentage is over .5 in 5 minutes
- **Vulnerability Mitigated**:  Controlling the CPU usuage percentage at 50%, it will trigger a memory alert only if CPU remains at or above 50% consistently for 5 minutes. 
- **Reliability**: Yes, this alert can generate a lot of false positives due to CPU spikes occurring when specific integrations are initiated at the start of processing. 

#### HTTP Request Size Monitor
Http request size monitor is implemented as follows:
- **Metric**: http.request.bytes
- **Threshold**: The sum of the requested bytes is over 3500 in 1 minute
- **Vulnerability Mitigated**: By controlling the number of http request size through a filter, protection is enabled to detect or prevent against DDOS attacks for IPS/IDS. 
- **Reliability**: No, this alert doesn't generate an excessive amount of false positives because DDOS attacks submit requests within seconds not within minutes.
